/*
else if statements are part of a chain of conditions after the previous if statements. If
the previous are false then the program checks the else if. 
If it is true, then the else or else if statements below are not checked
else statement runs if the above conditions are false otherwise it will be skipped

by removing the else of an else if statement, a new conditional structure is created
where the program will check the condition despite the above conditions being met
This is just like creating a new if statement which is not affected by the statements on top
